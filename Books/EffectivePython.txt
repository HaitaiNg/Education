Effective Python 

-Lines should be 79 characters or less 
-Continuation of long expressions onto additional lines 
should be indented by four extra spaces from their 
-In a file, function and classes should be separated 
-In a class, methods should be separated by one blank 
-In a dictionary, put no whitespace between each key 
-Put a single space before the corresponding value 
-Functions, variables, and attributes should be in 
-Protected instance attributes should be in _leading_underscore 
-Private instance attributes should be __double_leading 
-Instance methods in class should use self, which refers 
-Class methods should use cls, which refers to the 
-Functions should not return more than 3 values 
-The rule of thumb is to avoid using more than two 
control subexpressions in a comprehension. This could 
be two conditions; two loops; one condition with one 
loop. Use helper functions as soon as things start 


:Encoding 
-str instances do not have an associated binary encoding, 
and bytes instances do not have an associated text 
-To convert unicode into binary data, you must call 
-To convert binary data into unicode data, you must 
-You can explicitly specify the encoding you want to 
use for these methods, or accept the system default, 

Zip wraps two or more iterators with a lazy generator. 
The Zip generator yields tuples contains the next value 
from each iterator. These tuples can be unpacked directly 
within the statement. Zip consumes the integrators 
it wraps one item at a time which means it can be used 
with infinitely long inputs without the risk of a program 

Zip allows you to iterate over multiple iterators in 
parallel. It creates a lazy generator that produces 
tuples so it can be used for infinitely long inputs. 
Zip truncates its output silently to the shortest iterator 

for i, name in enumerate(names): 
	count = counts[j] 
	if count > max_count: 
		longest_name = name 
		max_count = count 

For name, count in zip(names, counts): 
	if count > max_count: 
		longest_name = name 
		max_count = count 

Walrus Operator: Assignment expressions using the walrus 
operator ( := ) to assign and evaluate variable names 

Naive approach: 
	key = “wheat” 
	if key in counters:
		count = counters[key] 
	else:
		count = 0 
	counters[key] = count + 1 

Better approach: 
	try:
		count = counters[key] 
	except KeyError: 
		count = 0 
	counters[key] = count + 1 

Best approach: 
	count = counters.get(key, 0)
	counters[key] = count + 1 

if(names := votes.get(key) is None): 
	votes[key] = names = [] 
names.append(who) 

——— 
The built in @property decorator makes it easy for 
simple accesses of an instance’s attributes to act 
smarter. One advanced but common use of @property is 
transitioning what was once a simple numerical attribute 
into an on-the-fly calculation. This is extremely helpful 
because it lets you migrate all existing usage of a 
class to have new behaviors without requiring any of 
the call sites to be rewritten (which is especially 
important if there’s a calling code that you don’t
