# Notes from: 101 Things I learned In Law School

## Court Strategies:
- **If the law is in your favor, pound the law.**
- **If the facts are in your favor, pound the facts.**
- **If neither is in your favor, pound the table.**
  
  Few judges will rule against clear precedent. When it is in your favor, use it again and again. If the law does not clearly favor your argument, emphasize the facts of the case to engender sympathy for your client, so the judge or jury might favorably interpret any gray areas in the law.

  **And on second thought: don’t pound the table.**

## Insight and Understanding:
- **Insight doesn't arrive head-on.**
  
  Be suspicious of the person who sizes up a new position very quickly, claims understanding, and stakes out an ironclad position. Insight usually requires a long period of discussion, research, analysis, rationalization, and counterargument. It rarely arrives while attacking a matter directly or on a first pass. If someone occasionally is able to quickly understand a complex matter, they are far more likely to quickly misunderstand it.

## Types of Crimes

### State Crimes:
- **Pre-Trial Discovery:** Occurs early in proceedings, long before trial.  
- **Sentencing:** Mandatory minimums for some crimes, but with more flexibility compared to federal crimes.

  **Typically prosecuted in state court:**
  - Assault & battery
  - Domestic violence
  - Embezzlement
  - Fraud
  - Most misdemeanors
  - Murder
  - Operating under the influence
  - Possession of controlled substances
  - Rape / sex crimes / child molestation
  - Robbery / theft
  - Trafficking in controlled substances not crossing state lines

### Federal Crimes:
- **Pre-Trial Discovery:** Prosecutor not required to provide discovery in federal cases.  
- **Sentencing:** Severe mandatory minimums based on the nature of the crime.

  **Typically prosecuted in federal court:**
  - Bank robbery / bank fraud
  - Bribery of public officials
  - Crimes committed on federal property
  - Crimes involving state-to-state flight
  - Export crimes
  - Mail and wire fraud / theft
  - Money laundering
  - Securities fraud
  - Tax crimes
  - Trafficking in controlled substances across state lines

## Intent vs. Motive:
- **Intent can be essential; motive rarely is.**

  - **Motive** is the reason one has for committing a crime. It can help prosecution identify and indict a defendant, but it doesn’t provide direct evidence of guilt. For example, personal financial difficulty could suggest an individual had a motive to commit a robbery, but it is not direct evidence of their guilt.
  
  - **Intent** is the resolution to commit a crime. A defendant’s possession of tools for breaking a safe suggests an intent to commit burglary and theft, and may serve as evidence.

  **Motive** is not essential to the court when guilt is clearly established by the evidence. However, if the prosecution’s case is based largely on circumstantial evidence, **motive** might be a persuasive consideration—for either guilty or not guilty.

## Manslaughter Charges:
- **Did the killer intend to kill?**
  - First degree murder: Yes
  - Second degree murder: Usually
  - Voluntary manslaughter: No
  
- **Did the killing result from negligence?**
  - First degree murder: No
  - Second degree murder: No
  - Voluntary manslaughter: Yes

- **Was the killing premeditated?**
  - First degree: Yes
  - Second degree murder: No
  - Voluntary manslaughter: No
  - Involuntary manslaughter: No

- **Was the killing in the heat of passion?**
  - First degree: N/A
  - Second degree murder: Sometimes
  - Voluntary manslaughter: Yes
