# Notes from: The Big Short: Inside The Doomsday Machine



## Mortgage Bonds
The mortgage bond was different from traditional corporate and government bonds:
- A mortgage bond was a claim on cash flows from thousands of individual home mortgages.
- Borrowers could repay at any time, making cash flows unpredictable.
- Investors received cash back when rates dropped, forcing reinvestment at lower rates.

> "The investor in home loans didn't know how long his investment would last, only that he would get his money back when he least wanted it." (17)

## Subprime Lending
- Mortgage bonds began to include loans that didn't qualify for government guarantees.
- These loans were often given to less creditworthy homeowners to cash out home equity. (18)

> "Any business where you can sell a product and make money without having to worry how the product performs is going to attract sleazy people." (19)

**Key Quote:** *"How do you make poor people feel wealthy when wages are stagnant? You give them cheap loans."* (22)

## Ponzi Scheme
- To appear profitable, lenders continuously created more subprime loans, selling them to Wall Street banks. (23)

### Key Lesson:
> "Do not make loans to people who cannot repay them."

Instead, lenders adopted an "originate and sell" model â€” make loans, sell them off to investment banks, which packaged them into bonds for investors. (29)

## Wall Street Involvement
- By 2005, major banks like Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley had "shelves" of subprime mortgage products. (29)
- These were often disguised under obscure names like HEAT, SAIL, and GSAMP.

## Credit Default Swaps
- Insurance policies on corporate bonds with semi-annual premiums and fixed terms.
- Defined downside but exponential upside.

> "If I bought a credit default swap, my downside was defined and certain, and the upside was many multiples on it."

## Dr. Michael Burry
- A neurology resident turned investor.
- Managed Scion Capital with no leverage and avoided shorting stocks.
- His strategy relied on careful reading of financial statements. (44)

> "I don't dig into companies looking to short them, generally. I want the upside to be much more than the downside." (46)

## Hedge Funds and Ponzi Schemes
- Hedge funds with one-year commitments resemble Ponzi schemes in structure.

## FICO Scores
- Credit scores range from 300 (lowest) to 850 (highest), with a median of 723.
- Some lenders manipulated FICO scores to exploit rating agencies' standards. (82)

## Cheating the System
- "Thin file" FICO scores exploited short credit histories.
- Rating agencies accepted average FICO scores instead of individual scores, allowing risky borrowers to be masked by creditworthy ones. (82)

## Subprime Mortgage Bonds
- "Mezzanine" tranches disguised risky subprime mortgages as investment-worthy securities.

> "It took us weeks to really grasp it because it was so weird... That's fraud." (103)

## Wall Street Executives and Bailouts
- Executives of major Wall Street firms profited despite their firms' failures.
- Even those responsible for massive losses retained their wealth. (191)

## The Financial Crisis
- Key figures like Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke failed to foresee the crisis. (194)

## Michael Burry's Personal Struggles
- Faced emotional and social challenges during the crisis.
- Turned to learning about guitars as a coping mechanism. (169)

## Observations of Wall Street Culture
- Different financial roles could be identified by attire, train habits, and behavior. (177)

## Key Financial Concepts
- **Spread:** The difference between a bond's interest rate and a risk-free rate. (200)
- **CDO Tranches:** Divided into equity (highest risk), mezzanine, and senior layers with varied risk profiles. (201)
