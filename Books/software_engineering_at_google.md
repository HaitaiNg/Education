# Notes from: Software Engineering At Google

## Psychological Safety
- Lack of psychological safety occurs when team members fear taking risks or making mistakes due to fear of punishment.
- This often results in a culture of fear and reduced transparency.

## Knowledge Management
- **Information Islands:** Knowledge fragmentation occurs when teams fail to communicate or share resources.
- **Information Duplication:** Different teams independently create redundant solutions.
- **Information Skew:** Different teams adopt conflicting solutions to similar problems.
- **Single Point of Failure:** Critical knowledge being held by only one individual.
- **All-Or-Nothing Expertise:** Teams split between highly experienced experts and novices, with limited middle-ground expertise.

## Code Management
- **Haunted Graveyards:** Code that engineers avoid touching due to fear of breaking it.
- Googleâ€™s **Readability** peer review system instills confidence and consistency in code across teams.

## Knowledge Sharing
- Document insights from one-on-one discussions for future newcomers.

## Performance Ratings
- Indicative only of current performance and not predictive of future potential.
- Can inform how to better support employees in their roles.

## Sustainable Codebases
- Sustainable codebases allow safe changes throughout their lifecycle.

## Programming vs. Software Engineering
- **Programming:** Immediate act of writing code.
- **Software Engineering:** Policies, practices, and tools that ensure code remains useful and maintainable over time.

## Postmortem Structure
A good postmortem should include:
- Brief summary of the event.
- Timeline from discovery to resolution.
- Primary cause of the event.
- Impact and damage assessment.
- Immediate and preventative action items with assigned owners.

## Career Development
- Develop a habit of learning new skills daily.
- Read code written by experienced engineers.
- Fearlessly dive into unfamiliar code.
- Attend conferences, read books, and foster strong professional relationships.

## Managing Complexity Through Abstraction
- The right abstraction simplifies development and maintenance.
- Good abstractions create small, simple interfaces and improve engineering productivity.
- Poor abstractions lead to unexpected complexities and maintenance challenges.

## Automated Testing
- Unit tests and integration tests are essential for scalable codebases.
- Automated testing reduces regression issues and builds confidence for major refactors.
- Prioritize high-leverage tests to maximize impact.

## Handling Conflict
- If you disagree with a coworker, focus on flexible architecture solutions that support multiple perspectives.

## Answering Weakness Questions
- Example weakness: Getting bored when features are easy to implement due to clean code (humble brag).
- Always relate weaknesses back to commitment to code quality and protection.

## Proactive Engineers
- Ask questions about the codebase, product cycles, and release processes to demonstrate interest in team growth and long-term improvement.
- Companies prefer engineers who understand the impact of these processes and contribute proactively.

## Personal Development Challenges
1. Difficulty estimating task durations.
2. Frustration when blocked on tasks.
3. Need for positive reinforcement to maintain motivation.
4. Struggles with work/life balance.
