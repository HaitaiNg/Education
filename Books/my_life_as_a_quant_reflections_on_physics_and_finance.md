# Notes from: My Life as a Quant: Reflections on Physics and Finance

## Quantitative Finance

Quants practice quantitative finance. The subject is an interdisciplinary mix of physics-inspired models, mathematical techniques, and computer science, all aimed at the validation of financial securities. Best quantitative finance brings real insights into the relation between value and uncertainty. Physicists on Wall Street build models to determine the value of securities. 

- **Stocks** are commonplace securities. 
- An **option** is a bet that the stock price will rise. 
- An option is a special case of a general **derivative security**, a contract whose value is derived from the value of some other simpler underlying security on which it rests.

## Traders and Wall Street Behavior

Traders spend a majority of the day watching screens, assimilating economic information, paging frantically through spreadsheets, running programs written by quants, entering trades, talking to salespeople, brokers, and punching keys. Wall Street’s behavior is manic depressive. Fast or famine style of hiring and firing, expanding and contracting, large raises followed by large cuts — all mirrored in the waxing and waning of the food supply.

## The Struggle of Academia

I am proud of the struggle - preserving as much as mathematics has stood me in good stead on Wall Street as well as academia.  
(7 years to complete a PhD when trying to discover something new in any field, one has to spend many years thinking, making false starts, wandering down blind alleys, and stumbling down into ditches, only to emerge again and keep going).

### Postdoctoral Life
Postdoctoral life = priesthood. Blissful apotheosis of a life dedicated to knowledge.  
Top universities: no mundane obligations such as teaching, administrating, fixed hours.  
Find something worthwhile and work on it.  
Everyone worked to achieve something great and was willing to spend a lifetime doing it.  
Some professors would stop doing work once they reach "tenure status."  
“Publish or perish.”

## Statistics

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Visualizes the basic features of the data being studied.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Drawing conclusions on a smaller subset of the population.

## Data Mining

**Data mining**: Automation/exploratory statistical analysis on a large-scale databases.  
The goal is to extract patterns and knowledge from large-scale datasets so that they can be reshaped into a more understandable structure for later analysis.

## Technology in Non-Technical Companies

Non-technical companies see technology as a second priority and leave software projects to be siloed into business units. This leads to **technical sprawl**, which manifests when different business units implement their own initiatives without consulting each other, build conflicting/incompatible solutions, compromise security, and overload IT who are tasked with managing and monitoring this.

## Machine Learning

**Machine Learning (ML Engineers)**:  
Build machine learning solutions to solve business and customer problems. Deploy models, manage infrastructure, and run operations related to machine learning operations. They often collaborate with data scientists/engineers to manage databases and build data infrastructure to support products and services used by customers.

### Mathematical Aptitude
A background in mathematics and statistics is far more valued in machine learning than in traditional software engineering. Training ML models requires a sufficient background to understand which algorithms to apply and how to interpret and improve upon the results. For cutting-edge AI research positions, advanced mathematical intuition is a prerequisite to design and develop novel methodologies.
