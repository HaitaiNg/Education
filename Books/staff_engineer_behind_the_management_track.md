# Notes from: Staff Engineer Behind The Management Track

## Engineering Strategy

- To write an engineering strategy, outline **five design strategies**.  
- That's your engineering strategy.

## Engineering Vision

- To write an engineering vision, focus on **five engineering strategies**.  
- **Vision**: Write for **two to three years** out.  
- Ground it in your **business** and your **users**.  
- Keep documents **one to two pages long** (anything longer might lose focus).  
- Extrapolate **five strategies** into a vision; list the pros and cons and identify the trade-offs.

## Accelerate Best Practices

- Version control  
- Trunk-based development  
- CI/CD  
- Production observability (including monitoring)

## Interfaces

- Interfaces are **contracts between systems**.  
- Effective interfaces **decouple clients** from the encapsulated implementation.  
- Focus on **essential complexity**, avoiding unnecessary complexity (accidental complexity).

## Data Models

- Data models represent the intersection of **interfaces** and **state**, constraining your system’s capabilities.  
- A good data model is **rigid**: it only exposes what it **genuinely supports** and prevents invalid state expressions.

## General Guidelines

- **Never surprise your manager**.  
- **Don’t let the sponsor surprise you**.

## Promotion Packet

Your promotion packet is a **foundational tool** to:

- Demystify the **Staff promotion** process.  
- Prioritize the **right personal development** to ensure you get there.  
- Actively work on it.

## Advice for Promotion

- **Be open and honest** with your manager about what you want.  
- Tell your manager **what they want to hear**, but also communicate your own goals.

## Promotion Packet Process

1. **Write** the promotion packet.  
2. **Edit** the promotion packet.  
3. **Edit** the promotion packet with peers.  
4. **Edit** the promotion packet with your manager.

## If You Don’t Get Promoted

- If you don’t get promoted this cycle, ask:  
  - **What is the most effective thing I can do** to position myself for the next opportunity?

## Senior Engineer Preparation

- Refresh your **resume**.  
- Prepare for the **coding interview**.  
- Do some **research on the company**.  
- **Navigate ambiguity**: This is a key skill for senior and staff-level roles.  
- Use the **Staff-plus interview** as an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to handle ambiguity.
