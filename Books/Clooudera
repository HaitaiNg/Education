Cloudera Morphlines: open source framework used to integrate,
build, and change Hadoop processing applications that 
extract, transform, or load data into Apache Solr, Hbase, HDFS, 
data warehouses, or analytic dashboards. 

What is a morphline? Morphline is a config file that 
makes it easy to define a transformation chain
that is flexible with multiple types of data sources. 
CONFIG that processes and loads data into Hadoop. 
Replaces Java programming with simple config steps, 
thus reducing the cost and integration effort with 
developing, maintaining or integrating custom ETL projects. 

Morphline: (in memory container of transformation commands) 
A record is an in-memory data structure of name-vale pairs with 
optional blob attachments or POJO attachments. 

"Morphlines replaces Java programming with simple config 
steps, reducing the cost and effort of doing custom ETL: 
Morphline creates an efficient way to consume records 
(Flume events, HDFS files, RDBMS tables, Apache Avro objects) 

A record is a set of named fields where each field has an ordered list 
of one or more values. 
A value can be any Java Object. 
A record is essentially a hash table, where each hash table entry contains
a String key, and a list of Java objects as values 

""a record can contain an optional field named _attachment_body, which can be a Java java.io.InputStream or Java byte[]""

Morphline configuration file is implemented using HOCON format 
(human optimized config object notation) 

GROK-Dictionary: config file that contains prefabricated 
regular expressions that can be referred to by name
