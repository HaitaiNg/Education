# Staff Engineers Path

## Learning from Failure

Rather than deny reality and search for possible use cases for what they’d created, they killed the project and wrote a detailed retrospective. Was that a failure? Not really! Other teams were disappointed not to get the system they were hoping for.

## Sunk Cost Fallacy

- People are more likely to stick with something if they’ve already invested heavily in it, even if continuing is a bad idea.
- Notice if you’re in an impossible situation; if so, bail out early. Pushing forward with a doomed project just postpones the inevitable.
- Good judgment includes knowing when to cut your losses and stop.

## Competence

- As a staff-plus engineer or senior person, your role is to take on things that need to be done and reliably do them well.
- Competence includes building knowledge, being self-aware, and maintaining high standards.

## Collaboration

- The degree to which people want to work with you is a direct indication of your success as an engineer.
- Strive to be the engineer that everyone wants to work with. If not, reevaluate your approach.

## Developing Technical Skills

- Books are valuable, but there’s no substitute for hands-on experience.
- "You want to get so good at your craft that your focus can be almost entirely on what other people are doing, not your own execution."

## Career Progression

- **Grade V**: Senior engineer (8+ years)
- **Grade VI**: Principal engineer (10+ years)
- **Grade VII**: Director, city engineer, division engineer (15+ years)
- Don't rush past your prime learning years. 

## Mastering Problems

- Senior engineers own the whole problem, not just what goes as planned.
- When things go wrong, they navigate the problem and remain accountable.

## Code Reviews

- **Understand what is being completed.** Give an example of what could be better; be clear about what matters.
- **Does this work solve the problem?** Will it meet user needs without issues?
- **How will it handle failure?** Consider edge cases, malformed input, network issues, and load spikes.
- **Is it understandable?** Ensure others can maintain and debug the code.
- **Does it fit into the bigger picture?** Avoid creating patterns that increase future workload.
- **Do the right people know about it?** Ensure the right people are informed, with clear ownership for next steps.

## Mentorship and Growth

- Empower colleagues to become great engineers.
- For someone to be promoted to your level, they need to be as good as you were when you first reached that level.
- Three reasons to improve coworker skills:
  - Getting more done
  - Keeping technology up to date
  - Improving the industry

## What Matters to You?

- Financial security, flexible schedule, learning, visibility, cool projects, wealth, independence, health, etc.

## Staying at One Company

- **Feedback Loops:** Staying longer allows you to see the results of your decisions.
- **Depth:** Deeper understanding of domain and faster progress in familiar areas.
- **Relationships:** Established trust and goodwill within the organization.

## Moving to a New Company

- **Employability:** Staying too long at one place may limit transferable skills.
- **Experiences:** New environments provide fresh challenges and learning opportunities.
- **Growth:** Moving can unlock higher compensation or better roles.

## Internal Transfers

- Retain context, relationships, and credibility while starting fresh on new challenges.
- Think of it like starting a new low-level character as an experienced player.

## Learning and Growth

- Everything is learnable if it's worth the time investment.
- Check in with yourself to ensure your role still aligns with your goals.

## Engineering and Management

- The best frontline engineering managers are never more than 2-3 years removed from hands-on work.
- Great technical leaders often oscillate between IC and management roles.
- Engineering and management require different skill sets; focus on one at a time.

## Switching Jobs

- Restart by building new relationships, learning organizational dynamics, and adapting leadership styles.
- Stabilizing chaotic organizations requires learning the ropes and tailoring your leadership to the culture.
- When you switch to a new job: restart. You’ll need to build perspective again and draw a new locator map. You’ll need to learn the terrain, vulture, and politics and draw a new topographical map.
- Engineering leaders brought into embattled organizations tasked with stabilizing the chaos are often heavily incentivized to do this. Many times, these folks in my experience fail harder and more often than those who try to learn the organizational ropes and tailor their leadership style to fit the organizational culture.
