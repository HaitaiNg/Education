## Risks Associated with Owning Rental Properties
- Rent fluctuations  
- Liability  
- Vacancy  
- Fair housing pitfalls  
- Natural / man-made problems  
- Difficult tenants  

## Key Tips for Landlords
- **Ask your agent** to explain the actual cash value (ACV) vs. replacement cost value (RCV).
- The only way to control time investment is to detach from the emotional side of your investment.
- **Avoid personal relationships** with your tenants.
- **Find an attorney** before problems arise.

## Four Traits of Good Landlords
- Emotional detachment  
- Risk management  
- Commitment  
- Professionalism  

## When You Buy a House, Ask:
- How old is the roof, appliances, etc.?

## Property Types
- **Single Family:** Fewer people, fewer problems (but no income due to vacancy).
- **Multi-Family:** More revenue, but conflicts can arise between tenants.  
  - ROI for **multi-family** properties is higher than for single-family properties.

## What Tenants Look for in a Property:
- Location  
- Square footage; number of bedrooms and bathrooms  
- Condition and features  
- Curb appeal and landscaping  
- Appliances and construction standards  
- Flooring  
- Proper heating and cooling  
- Exterior components  
- Garages or outbuildings  
- Reliable utilities and services  
- Few busy streets  
- Proximity to fire department, EMS, police, train stations, airport, and freeway  
- Low crime rate  
- Other well-maintained homes nearby  

### Landscaping
- Tenants will most likely not take care of the landscaping.
- If renting out a property with a lawn, hire a landscaper.

## Flooring Choices:
- **Wood** is the best choice. Be sure to maintain it.
- **Carpet** is cheap but can hide uneven floors and dated surfaces. Also, difficult to clean if damaged by pets (e.g., cat urine).

## Heating:
- **Electric heating** is expensive.
- **Wood heating** is dangerous.

## Cooling:
- Replace air conditioning filters regularly. Clogged AC units consume more energy and stress the system.
- Most modern AC units can monitor their own performance.

### Emergency Maintenance Tips:
- Flood detector  
- Send notifications to tenants in areas with extreme temperatures.
- Emergency water shut-off  
- Emergency space heaters  
- Light bulb replacements  
- Furnace and refrigerator filters  
- Clogged drains and garbage disposals  
- Sewer line backups  
- Irrigation equipment / landscaping  
- Water spigots  
- Water cleaning  

## Pets
- **Charge:** $25 - $100 extra for pets.
- Consider the following issues with pets:
  - Pet hair and dander  
  - Scratches from claws  
  - Landscaping damage and public nuisance  
  - Urine stains and smells  
- **Advertisement Note:** "Pets allowed at the landlord's discretion."

## Professionalism and Tenant Relations:
- It is crucial to maintain a **professional relationship** with tenants, while also being respectful and courteous.
- Always maintain a level of suspicionâ€”if a tenant gives you a gut feeling that they will be difficult, consider alternatives.
- **Turnover** and associated vacancies are the largest detriment to revenue.
- **Tenant Screening:** Credit, criminal, and past residence checks are essential, though past residence checks can sometimes be unreliable.

## Credit Scores:
- A **credit score** (or FICO score) is generated by an algorithm specific to the company providing it.
- For self-employed tenants, request **bank statements** and **tax records**.
- **Good tenant selection** is crucial and difficult, which is why some people use property management companies.

## Legal Documents:
- Legal documents are often designed to be confusing to give landlords and their attorneys leverage.
- Anything in the lease is open to interpretation by either party, so ensure you understand and trust your lease and attorney.

### Writing Your Lease:
- **Spell out specific responsibilities** rather than using blanket statements. This gives weight to your position.
