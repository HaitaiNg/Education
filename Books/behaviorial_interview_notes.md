## Grokking the Behavioral Interview

### Interview Reflection
- I just heard my own response and it sounds a bit rehearsed. I really prepared for this interview because it is important to me. You can count on my answers being genuine even if they are practiced.

### Purpose of Behavioral Interviews
Behavioral interview questions are said to be 55% predictive of future on-the-job behavior.  
The focus of this interview is to assess your ability to work in teams and collaborate with others.  
Behavioral interviews test whether you are the type of person who will get overwhelmed with the job in three months and cause commotion.

### Homework
- Research the organization and study its values.  
- Practice responses.  
- Information like the organization’s mission statement, history, products, services, management, and culture will all be available on their website.  

#### Key Areas to Research:
- Industry and competition  
- Mission and values  
- Most important products and services  
- The size of the industry in the national or global economy  

### Common Behavioral Questions:
- A time when you felt a huge sense of accomplishment or success?  
- A time when you fixed something that wasn’t working?  
- A time when you made a challenging decision?  
- A time when you had to influence a leader or team?  
- A time when you were surprised or overlooked something?  
- A time when you removed barriers or came up with a creative solution?  
- A time when you failed but learned?  
- A time when you had to defuse an escalating situation?

### Interview Tips:
- Avoid talking in absolutes (e.g., "Never" or "Always").  
- You don’t have to wait until you need a moment. You can take a moment each time, which shows confidence and sets a relaxed, natural conversational pace.  

### Use "I" Instead of "We"
- **Example:** "I learned how important it is to take responsibility for a failure as the leader of a team. A few members of the team expressed their concerns about additional hardware testing, which I completely dismissed."  



## Reverse Interviewing

1. Always have questions ready to ask the interviewer (4-5).
- What are the most exciting projects you've worked on here?
- What do you like most about the organization?
- Can you describe the organization's overall management style and the type of person who usually does well here?
- Tell me about your most successful employees. What do they do that really sets them apart?
- What's your timeline for the next steps?
- Are there resources I could review in advance to get a head start on the learning curve?
- How has this organization changed since you joined?
2. Ask questions that came up during the interview if you feel comfortable.
3. Ask questions so that the interviewer can talk about themselves.
4. Ask open-ended questions.
5. If you run out of time or the interviewer is anxious to leave, then state:

   > "I have a few more questions, but I can send them to the recruiter. Thank you so much for your time."
