# Notes from: The Software Architect Elevator

## Key Concepts

### Technical Architects
- Should "ride the elevator" up and down, understanding both high-level strategy and low-level implementation.
- Feedback loops are crucial for architects to understand the impact of their decisions.
- Architects should act like gardeners, trimming what doesn’t fit and ensuring balance and harmony.

### Automated Testing
- Automated tests breed confidence, enabling teams to change code with certainty.

### Impact Measurement
- An architect's impact is typically measured by revenue growth or cost reduction.

### Leadership in Architecture
- Skill → Leadership → Impact
- Mentoring → Amplifying → Applying
- Feedback → Community → Prioritization

## Cognitive Biases
- **Confirmation Bias:** Tendency to interpret data in ways that confirm existing beliefs.
- **Loss Aversion:** Overemphasis on avoiding negative outcomes.
- **Prospect Theory:** Preference for smaller guaranteed gains over larger uncertain gains.
- **Micromort Value:** Willingness to pay to avoid risk.

## Organizational Challenges
- Traditional organizations may resist inquiries that expose poor decision discipline.

### Software Architecture
- Defined as the structure of system components, their relationships, and design principles.
- Architects should focus on minimizing early irreversible decisions by adopting flexible, modular designs.

### Decision Making
- Avoid making excessive early decisions when uncertainty is high.
- Emphasize decisions that enable flexibility rather than locking into fixed choices.

### Resistance to Change
- Systems and organizations resist change due to inertia and past success models.

### Consultants and Liability
- External consultants are often hard to hold accountable for poor decisions.

## Abstraction in Software
- Abstractions improve productivity by simplifying complexity.
- The best abstractions simplify the hardest parts while retaining flexibility.
- Examples include MapReduce, which simplifies distributed data processing while allowing custom logic.

## Managing Legacy Systems
- Legacy systems are costly due to manual processes, instability, and inefficient scaling.
- Legacy systems consume valuable engineering resources that could be used more effectively elsewhere.

### Tacit Knowledge
- Undocumented knowledge slows growth and onboarding.
- Encoding tacit knowledge into code, scripts, or tools improves knowledge sharing.

## Communication and Writing
- Write with clarity to ensure your audience can follow your content without excessive referencing.
- Writing well in poor-documentation cultures can raise your visibility but may disrupt internal politics.

### Organizational Efficiency
- Internal black markets emerge when resource allocation depends on internal politics rather than clear processes.

## Fast Software Development and Deployment
- **Velocity:** Ensures code changes happen quickly without excessive delays.
- **Confidence:** Assured code correctness through rigorous testing and reviews.
- **Repeatable:** Automated processes ensure consistent deployments.
- **Feedback:** Monitoring to detect production issues early.
- **Secure:** Protects systems against attacks, especially when deploying new dependencies.

### Automation vs. Manual Efforts
- Automate repetitive tasks; manual processes are inefficient and short-sighted.

## Standardization
- Standardizing connecting elements (e.g., monitoring tools) can be more impactful than standardizing endpoints (e.g., laptops).

## Overcoming Complacency
- Artificially increasing discomfort can drive change before a real crisis occurs.

## Cultural Practices
- Google’s "dogfooding" practice involves employees testing alpha or beta versions of their own products.
- Hiring younger employees helps align company culture with digital trends.
- Internal organization black market: If the answer to "how long does it take" is "depends on who you ask" then you have a black market. 

### Examples of Efficiency
- Google's self-service Tech Stop enabled USB cable retrieval in 2.5 minutes versus weeks in traditional IT setups.

## Financial Management
- Companies with too much money often default to the "Highest Paid Person's Opinion" (HiPPO) rather than rational investment metrics.

### Outsourcing Risks
- Outsourcing IT hampers innovation by detaching the organization from key decision cycles.

### Talent Retention
- Offering higher salaries is rarely enough; top talent values learning opportunities and rapid project implementation over pay alone.
