# Notes from: On Writing Well

Every profession has its growing arsenal of jargon to throw dust in the eyes of the populace. The list would be tedious. Beware, then, of the long word that’s no longer than the short word:  
- "assistance" (help)
- "numerous" (many)
- "facilitate" (ease)
- "remainder" (rest)
- "initial" (first)

Don’t inflate what you mean.

## Technique to Identify Word Clutter

Put brackets around every component in a piece of writing that wasn’t doing useful work. Often, just one word or sentence got bracketed:  
- The unnecessary preposition appended to a verb (e.g., "order up").
- The adverb that carries the same meaning as the verb (e.g., "smile happily").
- The adjective that states a known fact (e.g., "tall").

## Writing Clutter

- Don’t repeat what was previously stated.
- Look for the clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly. Be grateful for everything you can throw away.
- Reexamine:  
  - Is every word doing new work?  
  - Can any thought be expressed with more economy?  
  - Are you hanging on to something useless just because it's there?  
- **Simplify, simplify.**

## Clarity and Purpose in Writing

Never say anything in writing that you wouldn’t comfortably say aloud.

Therefore, ask yourself some basic questions before you start:
- "In what capacity am I going to address the reader?" (Reporter? Provider of information? Average person?)
- "What pronoun and tense am I going to use?"
- "What style?" (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?)
- "What attitude am I going to take toward the material?" (Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic? Amused?)
- "How much do I want to cover?"
- "What one point do I want to make?"

## Active vs Passive Voice

Use **active verbs** unless there is no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb (e.g., "Joe saw").

---

## Avoiding Unnecessary Adverbs and Adjectives

- Most adverbs are unnecessary. You will clutter your sentence and annoy the reader if you add an adverb that carries the same meaning as the verb. Strong verbs are weakened by weak adverbs.
- Most adjectives are unnecessary. Some nouns denote and describe the adjective implicitly (e.g., dirt is brown, and the sea has waves).

Eliminate every such fact that is a known attribute: don't tell us that the sea had waves and the sand was hot.

## The Importance of Clear, Personal Writing

Any organization that won't take the trouble to be both clear and personal in its writing will lose friends, customers, and money. Let me put it another way for business executives: a shortfall will be experienced.

## Expressing Your Opinion

What is crucial for you as the writer is to express your opinion firmly. Don’t cancel its strength with unnecessary qualifications.

## Imitation as Part of the Process

Never hesitate to imitate another writer. Imitation is part of the creative process for anyone learning an art or craft. Bach and Picasso didn't spring full-blown as Bach and Picasso; they needed models. This is especially true of writing. Find the best writers in the fields that interest you and read their work aloud. Get their voice and their taste into your ear—their attitude toward language.

Don’t worry that by imitating them you’ll lose your own voice and identity. Soon enough, you will shed those skins and become who you are.
