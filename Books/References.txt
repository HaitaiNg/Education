HL7 For Busy Professionals: Your No Sweat Guide to Understanding HL7
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

In the past, railroads were not standardized. Each railroad company had a different gauge (the horizontal distance between two rails). There were 20 variations.

Due to this, there were multiple railroad lines, and there was a lot of unloading and loading.

Over time, the railroad system eventually standardized (e.g., track gauge, signal system, time zone, and all carts had a fixed coach height).

Healthcare is not standardized. This makes integrations and sharing information outside of the organization very difficult.

Some IT vendors came up with a solution to try and replace the standalone systems. This product is called the EHR (electronic health record) company (e.g., Cerner, Epic, Meditech, AllScripts, Athena).

HL7 is an ANSI OSI layer 7 application protocol. It tries to define the rules for exchanging data.

MAC address: Media Access Control ID. A six-byte number which has been stamped on every network interface card. This is referred to as the hardware or physical address. It cannot be changed.

For local addresses, the MAC address is all you need to determine where to send the packets (e.g., a post office delivery man within the same neighborhood).

There are multiple ways for data to become inconsistent. HL7 & Healthcare is late to the game of business process automation. Banks and other financial institutions use SWIFT.

The hub-and-spoke model solved the problems of exponentially increasing connections of computer systems.

The publish-and-subscribe model: A channel connects to the hub and subscribes to a topic; if there is a modification to one of the sources, the source sends a notification to the hub; the subscribers pull from these topics. (The major pro of this technology is that sources do not need to keep track of their recipients. The hub keeps track of who owes what.)

Message Triggers: service requests; event notification.

Three standards for an integration:
1. **Message transfer standard:** how a message will be sent.
2. **Message format standard:** what a message will look like.
3. **Data standard:** how healthcare information will be organized in a message.

HL7 cares about: message format; data standards.

Ideally, there is one standardized schema that all companies and organizations follow.

HL7 is backwards compatible, and because of this, there are a lot of optional fields in their spec. “Every time two systems need to communicate, a unique HL7 interface has to be created with all options and customization involved” (40).

HL7 has two versions (v2.5xx, which is old, and v3.0, which is also very old). HL7 3.0 came out in 2005. Europe uses HL7 3.0.

Solicit Messaging: “To ask for something from someone.”
Unsolicited Messaging: “To get something from someone without asking.”

If a system asks another system for a message, that is soliciting (e.g., database query).

Most HL7 messages are unsolicited. This means we only send updates when ready; we do not bother or pester the person we are asking.

HL7 message types are organized by their function (e.g., an “order” message means someone is ordering something).

The most common type of HL7 message is Patient Administration Messages. These messages should contain everything related or associated with the patient.

ADT (Admit, Discharge, Transfer) messages. All Patient Administration Messages are ADT.

HL7 triggers an event. An HL7 message is created only when something happens. The workflow looks like this:
1. Hospital staff completes the ADMIT form and hits “Enter”.
2. An HL7 message is created.

Message Acknowledgement: A message is sent from the recipient to the sender to notify that the message was received.
- **AA:** positive acknowledgement (Happy path)
- **AE:** negative acknowledgement (Message contains error)
- **AR:** negative (processing error)

HL7 has two types of Acknowledgements (Original and Enhanced). Most hospital systems use Original.

- **HL7 Original:** Basic, straightforward notifications primarily using ADT messages. Suitable for simple, point-to-point communication without advanced processing needs.
- **HL7 Enhanced:** Advanced notifications supporting a wider range of message types with sophisticated routing, filtering, transformation, and security features. Suitable for complex, critical healthcare integration scenarios. The Enhanced version may send additional status messages, acknowledgements, and error handling communications, therefore increasing the overall message count.

The Building Blocks of HL7:
- A message is made up of segments.
- A segment is made up of fields separated by pipes (|).
- A field is made up of components separated by a caret (^).
- A component is made up of sub-components separated by an ampersand (&).

To read a message, you will need the interface specification document (interface spec).

Organizations tweak the rules (e.g., only allow numbers in an alphanumeric field) and these rules are documented in the interface spec.

The high-level anatomy of a message:
- **HEAD:** The first two or three segments at the top of the message (control segments).
- **BODY:** The rest (data segments).

“Interface specs are the key for our work. There is no set structure for an interface spec. People do their own thing” (66).

Some helpful acronyms:
- **Trigger event**
- **MSH-7:** When the message was generated.
- **EVN-2:** Holds the date and time for when the trigger event was fired.
- **PID:** Patient identification segment.
- **NK1:** Next of kin segment.
- **PV1:** Patient visit segment.
- **PV2:** Patient visit additional information segment.
- **ALI:** Allergy information segment.
