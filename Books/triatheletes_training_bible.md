## Nutrition

- Tart cherry juice prior to sleeping (176)
- Eat protein in the evening as protein leads to less sleep disruptions

### Ideal Recovery Foods:

- Bananas
- Raisins
- Juices
- Potatoes
- Grains
- Pasta

### Carbohydrate Requirements:
- 1.185 grams of carbohydrates per kg of body weight
- 0.016-0.03 oz per pound
  - 150 lb = 2.4-4.4 oz (68-127.6g of carbs)

# Notes from: Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen 
But you can’t muscle through a five-hour run that 
way; you have to relax into it, like easing your body 
into a hot bath, until it no longer resists the shock 
and begins to enjoy it. (59) 

That was the real secret of the Tarahumara: they’d 
never forgotten what it felt like to love running. 
They remembered that running was mankind’s first 
fine art, our original act of inspired creation. Way 
before we were scratching pictures on caves or beating 
rhythms on hollow trees, we were perfecting the art 
of combining our breath and mind and muscles into fluid 
self-propulsion over wild terrain. And when our ancestors 
finally did make their first cave paintings, what were 
the first designs? A downward slash, lightning bolts 
through the bottom and middle—behold, the Running 
Man. 
(79)

Distance running was revered because it was indispensable; 
it was the way we survived and thrived and spread across 
the planet. You ran to eat and to avoid being eaten; 
you ran to find a mate and impress her, and with her 
you ran off to start a new life together. You had to 
love running, or you wouldn’t live to love anything 
else. And like everything else we love—everything 
we sentimentally call our “passions” and “desires”—it’s 
really an encoded ancestral necessity. We were born 
to run; we were born because we run. We’re all Running 
People, as the Tarahumara have always known. 
But the American approach—ugh. Rotten at its core. 
It was too artificial and grabby, Vigil believed, too 
much about getting stuff and getting it now: medals, 
Nike deals, a cute butt. It wasn’t art; it was business, 
a hard-nosed quid pro quo. No wonder so many people 
hated running; if you thought it was only a means to 
an end—an investment in becoming faster, skinnier, 
richer— then why stick with it if you weren’t getting 
enough quo for your quid 

“Anything the Tarahumara eat, you can get very easily,” 
Tony told me. “It’s mostly pinto beans, squash, 
chili peppers, wild greens, pinole, and lots of chia. 
And pinole isn’t as hard to get as you think.” 
Nativeseeds.org sells it online, along with heritage 
seeds in case you want to grow your own corn and whiz 
up some homemade pinole in a coffee grinder. Protein 
is no problem; according to a 1979 study in The American 
Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the traditional Tarahumara 
diet exceeds the United Nations’ recommended daily 
intake by more than 50 percent. As for bone-strengthening 
calcium, that gets worked into tortillas and pinole 
with the limestone the Tarahumara women use to soften 
the corn. 

“How about beer?” I asked. “Any benefit to drinking 
like the Tarahumara?” 
“Yes and no,” Tony said. “Tarahumara tesgüino 
is very lightly fermented, so it’s low in alcohol 
and high in nutrients.” That makes Tarahumara beer 
a rich food source—like a whole-grain smoothie— 
while ours is just sugar water. I could try home-brewing 
my own corn near-beer, but Tony had a better idea. 
“Grow some wild geranium,” he suggested. “Or 
buy the extract online.” Geranium niveum is the Tarahumara 
wonder drug; according to the Journal of Agricultural 
and Food Chemistry, it’s as effective as red wine 
at neutralizing disease-causing free radicals. As one 
writer put it, wild geranium is “anti- everything—anti-inflammatory, 
antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant.” 
I stocked up on pinole and chia, and even ordered some 
Tarahumara corn seeds to plant out back: cocopah and 
mayo yellow chapalote and pinole maiz.

Scott stumbled upon the most advanced weapon in the 
ultrarunner’s arsenal: instead of cringing from fatigue, 
you embrace it. You refuse to let it go. You get to 
know it so well, you’re not afraid of it anymore. 
Lisa Smith-Batchen, the amazingly sunny and pixie-tailed 
ultrarunner from Idaho who trained through blizzards 
to win a six-day race in the Sahara, talks about exhaustion 
as if it’s a playful pet. “I love the Beast,” 
she says. “I actually look forward to the Beast showing 
up, because every time he does, I handle him better. 
I get him more under control.” Once the Beast arrives, 
Lisa knows what she has to deal with and can get down 
to work. And isn’t that the reason she’s running 
through the desert in the first place—to put her 
training to work? To have a friendly little tussle 
with the Beast and show it who’s boss? You can’t 
hate the Beast and expect to beat it; the only way 
to truly conquer something, as every great philosopher 
and geneticist will tell you, is to love it. (105) 

“Unlike any other organism in history, humans have 
a mind-body conflict: we have a body built for performance, 
but a brain that’s always looking for efficiency.” 
We live or die by our endurance, but remember: endurance 
is all about conserving energy, and that’s the brain’s 
department. “The reason some people use their genetic 
gift for running and others don’t is because the 
brain is a bargain shopper.” 
For millions of years, we lived in a world without 
cops, cabs, or Domino’s Pizza; we relied on our legs 
for safety, food, and transportation, and it wasn’t 
as if you could count on one job ending before the 
next one began. Look at !Nate’s wild hunt with Louis; 
!Nate sure wasn’t planning on a fast 10k immediately 
after a half-day hike and a high-speed hunt, but he 
still found the reserve energy to save Louis’s life. 
Nor could his ancestors ever be sure that they wouldn’t 
become food right after catching some; the antelope 
they’d chased since dawn could attract fiercer animals, 
forcing the hunters to drop lunch and run for their 
lives. The only way to survive was to leave something 
in the tank—and that’s where the brain comes in. 
“The brain is always scheming to reduce costs, get 
more for less, store energy and have it ready for an 
emergency,” Bramble explained. “You’ve got this 
fancy machine, and it’s controlled by a pilot who’s 
thinking, ‘Okay, how can I run this baby without 
using any fuel?’ You and I know how good running 
feels because we’ve made a habit of it.” But lose 
the habit, and the loudest voice in your ear is your 
ancient survival instinct urging you to relax. And 
there’s the bitter irony: our fantastic endurance 
gave our brain the food it needed to grow, and now 
our brain is undermining our endurance. 
“We live in a culture that sees extreme exercise 
as crazy,” Dr. Bramble says, “because that’s 
what our brain tells us: why fire up the machine if 
you don’t have to?” 
To be fair, our brain knew what it was talking about 
for 99 percent of our history; sitting around was a 
luxury, so when you had the chance to rest and recover, 
you grabbed it. Only recently have we come up with 
the technology to turn lazing around into a way of 
life; we’ve taken our sinewy, durable, hunter-gatherer 
bodies and plunked them into an artificial world of 
leisure. And what happens when you drop a life-form 
into an alien environment?
