Every second counts in HFT. The whole point of the fiber optic line was to create 
public markets a private space accessible only to those 
willing to pay millions of dollars in entry fees.

The best way to manage people, he thought, was to convince 
them that you were good for their careers. He further 
believed that the only way to get people to believe 
that you were good for their careers was actually to 
be good for their careers. These thoughts came naturally 
to him: They just seemed obvious. (135) 

The way Americans handled their money had led to market 
chaos, and the market chaos created life chaos: The 
jobs and careers of everyone around him were suddenly 
on the line. “Every day I’d walk home and feel 
as if I had just got hit by a car.” He wasn’t naïve. 
He knew that there were good guys and bad guys, and 
that sometimes the bad guys win; but he also believed 
that usually they did not. That view was now challenged. 
When he began to grasp, along with the rest of the 
world, what big American firms had done—rigged credit 
ratings to make bad loans seem like good loans, created 
subprime bonds designed to fail, sold them to their 
customers and then bet against them, and so on—his 
mind hit some kind of wall. For the first time in his 
career, he felt that he could only win if someone else 
lost, or, more likely, that someone else could only 
win if he lost. He was not by nature a zero-sum person, 
but he had somehow wound up in the middle of a zero-sum 
business. (196) 

The online broker TD Ameritrade, for example, was paid 
hundreds of millions of dollars each year to send their 
orders to a high-frequency trading firm called Citadel 
which executed the orders on their behalf. Why was 
Citadel willing to pay so much to see the flow? No 
one could say with certainty. (266) 

High Frequency Trading firms will pay large 
amounts of money for real estate.
They need to be closer to the HUB 
in order to reduce propagation delay. 

After the meeting, RBC conducted a study, never released 
publicly, in which they found that more than two 
hundred SEC staffers since 2007 had left their government 
jobs to work for high-frequency trading firms or the 
firms that lobbied Washington on their behalf. Some 
of these people had played central roles in deciding 
how, or even whether, to regulate high-frequency trading. 
For instance, in June 2010, the associate director 
of the 
SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets, Elizabeth 
King, had quit the SEC to work for Getco. The SEC, 
like the public stock exchanges, had a kind of equity 
stake in the future revenues of high- frequency traders.

When you create something out of chaos, essentially, 
you reduce the entropy in the world (743) 

The funny thing was that Serge actually liked Adam 
Schles-inger, and most of the other people he worked 
with at Goldman. He liked less the 
environment the firm created for them to work in. “Everyone 
lived for the year-end number,” he said. “You 
get satisfied when the bonus is sizable and you get 
not satisfied when the number is not. Everything there 
is very possessive.” It made no sense to him the 
way people were paid individually for achievements 
that were essentially collective achievements. “It 
was quite competitive. Everyone’s trying to show 
how good their individual contribution to the team 
is. Because the team doesn’t get the bonus, the individual 
does.” More to the point, he felt that the environment 
Goldman created for its employees did not encourage 
good programming, because good programming required 
collaboration. “Essentially there was very minimal 
connections between people,” he says. “In telecom 
you usually have some synergies between people. Meetings 
when people exchange ideas. They aren’t under stress 
in the same way. At Goldman it was always, ‘Some 
component is broken and we’re losing money because 
of it. Fix it now.’ ” The programmers assigned 
to fix the code sat in cubicles and hardly spoke to 
one another. “When two people wanted to talk they 
wouldn’t just do it out on the floor,” says Serge. 
“They would go to one of the offices around the floor 
and close the door. I never had that experience in 
telecom or academia.” (745) 

At the same time, he went looking for people: software 
developers and hardware engineers and network engineers 
to build the system, the operations people to run it, 
and the salespeople to explain it to Wall Street. (838) 

A Hide Not Slide order was a way for a high-frequency 
trader to cut in line, ahead of the people who’d 
created the line in the first place, and take the kickbacks 
paid to whoever happened to be at the front of the 
line. (893) 

If the incarceration experience doesn’t break your 
spirit, it changes you in a way that you lose many 
fears. You begin to realize that your life is not ruled 
by your ego and ambition and that it can end any day 
at 
any time. So why worry? You learn that just like on 
the street, there is life in prison, and random people 
get there based on the jeopardy of the system. The 
prisons are filled by people who crossed the law, as 
well as by those who were incidentally and circumstantially 
picked and crushed by 
somebody else’s agenda. On the other hand, as a vivid 
benefit, you become very much independent of material 
property and learn to appreciate very simple pleasures 
in life such as the sunlight and morning breeze. (1354)
