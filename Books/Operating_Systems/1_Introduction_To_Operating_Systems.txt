A system is called a real-time system when we need quantitative expression of time 
(real-time) to describe the behavior of the system. 
Real time systems can be constrainted by the environment. 

A fail safe system is one in which if entered no damage will occur 

A safety critical system is one in which cause severe damages 

How to achieve reliability:
Error Avoidance: Possibility of error should be minimized (Testing, Improvements In Design) 
Error Detection & Removal: Reviews / Extensive Testing 
Fault Tolerance: Built in Self Testing; Run tests on internal componenets. Automatic Reconfigurations 
Triple Modular Redundancy: Critical Components are copied 3x 
N Version Programming: Hardware fault tolerance. Multiple teams work on N different versions. 
Recovery blocks
