IP Protocols know two device types: hosts and routers 
Hosts send packets directly to devices on the same router 
Routers can forward packets to machines on other networks 

IP Address: Defined as four 8 bit numbers 
IP Address: network address + host address 

TCP is more the most relibale communication network Protocols
TCP establishes connection : 3-way handshake 
1.) Client sends SYN message to the server 
2.) Server sends ACK back to the client 
3.) Client sends "SYN-ACK" back to the client 
Connection is established, traffic may flow in both directions 
TCP uses packet acknowledgement and uses CRC codes. 

UDP: No connection establishment. Host sends data to a 
listening port and prays for the best.
