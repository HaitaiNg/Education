Jamie Dion & Steve Jobs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People are expected to do what it takes to get the job done,
but they don’t have to go at it alone.
Not getting the job done, though is never an option - Jamie Dimon

“We all have a short period of time on this earth.
We probably only have the opportunity to do a few things really great and do them well.
None of us has any idea how long we’re going to be here, nor do I,
but my feeling is I’ve got to accomplish a lot of things while I’m young. “
— Steve Jobs

This role is aligned with where I want to grow in my career and what
i’ve been working towards, and given my skills and experiences.
I feel I can make a significant contribution to both this team and company,
as as part of the overall team help drive the the company the next level.

Why are you looking to leave your current position?
My previous role was very rewarding and enabled me to make a
contribution to the company and its partners and customers,
however i feel i am ready to take on a larger role and set of
responsibilities and my current company is not at a stage where they
can offer me this opportunity

If you have a long gap between your last role / position
After being let go from my previous company, I took some time off to reflect on
 what is important to me in my career and to ensure i had time to update my
 skills and perspective ahead of moving into my next role. I took some off
 due to family, travel, recharge and fresh skills

Work environment: I like to be surrounded by colleagues who are passionate and
energized about what they do. This fuels my energy levels and helps me perform at work

Why should we hire you?
My experience working in a variety of roles and across the entire organization
has provided me with a strong ability to apply my skills to your team and
contribute to the success of the team and company.

me to fill you in on what I am doing? Would you prefer a detailed analysis,
a brief summary with recommendations, or some other approach? In my last report
 did I give too much or too little information? Do you have any suggestions about
 how I could present information like this in away that would be more useful
 to you?
