Jamie Dion & Steve Jobs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People are expected to do what it takes to get the job done,
but they don’t have to go at it alone.
Not getting the job done, though is never an option - Jamie Dimon

We all have a short period of time on this earth.
We probably only have the opportunity to do a few things really great and do them well.
None of us has any idea how long we’re going to be here, nor do I,
but my feeling is I’ve got to accomplish a lot of things while I’m young. 
— Steve Jobs

Career movement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This role is aligned with where I want to grow in my career and what
I’ve been working towards, and given my skills and experiences.
I feel I can make a significant contribution to both this team and company,
as as part of the overall team help drive the the company the next level.

Why are you looking to leave your current position?
My previous role was very rewarding and enabled me to make a
contribution to the company and its partners and customers,
however I feel I am ready to take on a larger role and set of
responsibilities and my current company is not at a stage where they
can offer me this opportunity

If you have a long gap between your last role / position
After being let go from my previous company, I took some time off to reflect on
what is important to me in my career and to ensure I had time to update my
skills and perspective ahead of moving into my next role. I took some off
due to family, travel, recharge and fresh skills

Work environment: I like to be surrounded by colleagues who are passionate and
energized about what they do. This fuels my energy levels and helps me perform at work

Why should we hire you?
My experience working in a variety of roles and across the entire organization
has provided me with a strong ability to apply my skills to your team and
contribute to the success of the team and company.

Grokking The Behavioral Interview
---------------------------------

I just heard my own response and it sounds a bit rehearsed. 
I really prepared for this interview because it is important to me. You can 
count on my answers being genuine even if they are practiced.

Behavioral Interview Questsions are said to be 55 percent predictive of future
on-the-job behavior. 
Are you calm under pressure? Are you comfortable giving formal presentations? 
Can you respectfully give your boss bad news? The focus of this interview
is to see your ability in whether you can work in teams and collaborate with others

Behavioral interviews exists to test whether you are the person who 
will get overwhelmed with the job in three months and cause commotion. 

Homework: Research the organization, study the values of the organization, practice
the response. 
Information like the organization’s mission statement, history, products, services, management, 
and culture will all be present on their website. 

Industry. Competitions and competitors. Mission and values. 
Most important products and services. What is the size of the industry with respect 
to the national or global economy. 

Time when you felt a huge sense of accomplishment or success? 
    Data Usage (Automation Testing) / Testing of status on data nodes 
Time when you fixed something that wasn't working? UAT and Production errors 
Time when you made a challenging decision? Software Design, UML 
Time when you had to influence a leader or team? FitNesse (Automation Testing)
Time when you got suprised by something or overlooked something? Rules & Policies 
Time when you removed barriers or came up with a creative solution? Standardization

A time when you had to defuse an escalating situation? 

Avoid talking in absolutes: (Never and Always)
You don’t have to wait until you need a moment. 
You can take a moment each time. 
This shows confidence and sets a relaxed and natural conversational pace.

Use "I" instead of "We" 
I learned how important it is to take responsibility for a failure
as the leader of a team. A few members of the team expressed their 
concerns about additional hardware testing, that I completely dismissed 

"Great to hear from you. I am not at my desk and will not be able 
to give this call the attention it deserves. When can I call you back?"

"You want to be extra rigorous about making the best poissible thing
you can. Find everything that's wrong with it and fix it. Seek negative
feedback particularly from friends" - Elon Musk 

"You cant connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them 
looking backward. So, you have to trust that the dots will somehow 
connect in your future" - Steve Jobs
