MapReduce provides a programming model that abstracts the problem from disk
reads and writes, transforming it into a computation over sets 
of keys and values. 
Hadoop provides a reliable, scalable, platform for storage analysis 
HBase: a key-value store that uses HDFS for its underlying storage.
HBase provides both online read/write access of individual rows and batch 
operations for reading and writing data in bulk. 

YARN : Yet another resource negotiator. YARN is a cluster resource management system
which allows any distributed program (not just Hadoop) to run on a Hadoop cluster.

Relational database management system vs MapReduce 
Hadoop works well on unstructured or semi-structured data because it
is designed to interpret the data at processing time (schema on read) 
A mapreduce job: input data, mapreduce program, configruation information 
Hadoop does its best to run the map task on a node where the input data 
resides in HDFS, because it does not use valuable cluster bandwidth (data locality optimization)

Filesystems that manage the storage across a network of machines are distributed filesystems
Node failure without suffering data loss. 
HDFS: write once, read many times.
