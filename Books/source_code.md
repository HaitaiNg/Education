# README: Notes from Source Code by Bill Gates

> The axiom that you learn more from your failures than your success is trite but absolutely true. 

## Bill's first computer program 

```
Ready. 
10 INPUT X, Y
20 LET A=X+Y
30 PRINT A 
40 END 
```

> Game of tic-tac-toe: When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. 
I love how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details.

## On Programming 
> Programming doesn’t require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work—some more elegant and efficient than others—but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.

## Ambition, consistency, and discipline 
> Why am I wasting time here when I could be at the computer?
It was around ten o’clock. My parents were upstairs. Kristi was in her room studying, I quietly slid open my bedroom window, climbed out, crept under our deck and around the side of our house. In a few minutes I was at Children’s Hospital, where I caught the No. 30 Laurelhurt-Ballard bus to Roosevelt Way. I walked four blocks down Roosevelt to C-Cubed. Twenty minutes door to door... 

> That would be the first of many nights. I sneaked out that winter and for years later. I would join hospital workers taking the late running No. 30 home. If I missed the last return bus, around two in the morning, I’d walk the forty-five minutes home, rewriting code in my head, tuning out the students spilling from the bars and coffee shops...

> A lot of successful people I’ve met have described how after falling in love with their chosen field, they had to put in a period of hard, focused work. It’s the time in which raw interest is transformed into real skill. In Outliers, Malcom Gladwell describes the first 10,000 hours of deliberate practice it takes to reach a high skill level—whether its’ writing music or playing tennis...

> For about three weeks, Kent and I and four teachers worked twenty-hour days, trying to cobble together a schedule in time for the next trimester. We skipped school, and struggled to not make mistakes at each night wore on and we fought off fatigue. I remember falling asleep at the punch-card machine while typing, realizing that it was three in the morning, and not remembering what day of the week it was. I remember another teacher suggesting that we go home for a few days to say hello to our parents—it had been a few days... 

> Paul and I got there early every day and put in long hours. Over time, they gave us increasingly more significant jobs. 
I prided myself on writing code fast, in long stretches of intense work. I can only imagine what the seasoned professional programmers at Bonneville thought of the kid working like a maniac late into every night, burning out code and eating Tang powdered drink mix straight from the jar until his tongue turned orange. I broke my record for sustained work that spring, once not leaving the Time Tunnel underground for nearly a hundred hours straight. That meant not showering and hardly eating for nearly four days... 

> After graduation, I spent mysummer back in Vancouver, toggling between all-nighters in the Time Tunnel coding with Paul and water-skiing on the Columbia River, where one of the Bonnesville engineers kept a boat...

> The three of us lived together in a run-down Vancouver apartment. Late at night we’d use the Bonnesville PDP-10 to work on our side jobs, writing software for our traffic-counting venture and helping Lakeside update the class scheduling program. I was working crazy hours, subsisting on Tang and pizza; it felt like the most free and easy time I’d had in my life... 

> The engineers got a kick out of my eagerness to take on whatever they threw at me. They’d give me an assignment just to see how fast and how well—or not—I could write it, knowing that I’d spend all night trying. Sometimes they had already written the code themselves, so when I was done, I’d compare my work to theirs, absorbing lessons from their smarter subroutines and clever algorithms... 

> What does it take to be 20 percent better than everyone else? How much is that just latent talent versus dedicated effort—being relentlessly focused and deliberate about performing better today than you did the day before? And then repeating that tomorrow and the next day and the next for years and years? 

> I threw myself into a daily rhythm that worked for me even if it seemed extreme to my friends. Between studying and programming, I could be awake for thirty-six hours at a stretch. Whenever exhaustion took over, I’d head back to Wigg A-11, crash for 12 or more hours, often fully clothed, sometimes with my shoes on, always with my yellow electric blanket over my head to block the daylight. When I woke up, I’d gobble something quick with Jim Jenkins or Sam, maybe stop by the suite to see Andy and Jim, and then head to class, the library, or back to Aiken. 

> Paul would finish his day job at MITS, walk over to our part of the building to put in a few hours on Micro-Soft, then go home to sleep for a bit before returning at 2 a.m. to find me still at the terminal. As MITS employees arrived at work later that morning, Paul and I would head to Denny’s for breakfast, then I’d go back to 114 Portals to sleep for the rest of the day. By that time we had also set up a terminal in our living room that you would connect over the phone line to the school district computer. Most days, Ric rolled off the couch and planted himself at that terminal, hammering out the 6800 BASIC code. On the floor would be strewn pages of our 8080 BASIC code he used as a guide.
We never cooked at home, and aside from a jar of pickled pigs’ feet that Chris bought as a joke, our refrigerator was mostly empty. We ate every meal out, often at Furr’s Cafeteria, one of a small local chain of restaurants, where I tried chicken-fried steak for the first time, and then by habit ate it nearly every time we went to Furr’s from then on. I remember lots of Mexican food, consuming buckets of chile con queso and daring each other to eat a certain blistering green chile hot sauce.

> I could shut out the rest of this world. Driven by the sense of responsibility I felt for Microsoft. I had closed the hatch door and locked the wheel. No girlfriend. No hobbies. My social life centered around Paul, Rick, and the people we worked with. It was the one way I knew to stay ahead. And I expected similar dedication from the others. We had this huge opportunity in front of us. Why wouldn’t you work eighty hours a week in pursuit of it? Yes it was exhausting, but it was exhilarating. 

> Think week. Once or twice a year I’d drive or take a seaplane taxi out to spend seven uninterrupted days poring over books, articles, and papers — a crash course in whatever I felt I needed to learn. 

## Grief 
> Throughout my life, I have tended to deal with loss by avoiding it: tamping it down to make it through the early stages of grief and then quickly setting my focus on a distraction that fully engages my mind. As a family we didn’t dwell on the past; we always looked forward with the expectation that something better lay ahead. 

## On Relationships 

> My objective conclusion about our relationship is that we have much in common and a very fine thing. We want much the same social life and home life. I think it’s true that we both want a very close marriage—that is, we want we two to be one. Although our social and family backgrounds are different, I think that we are able to be understanding about problems evolving from this, because as individuals we are much the same. We do both like to be dealing with ideas—to be continually thinking and learning… We both want the same—all the success in the world that can be gotten honestly and fairly. Even though we prize success highly, neither of us would consider it being worth it to be unjust so to push another man down. We would like our children to have the same basic values. Perhaps our “means” would be somewhat different but I am inclined to think that we would present a solid front that would complement both of our points of view. - Mary Maxwell to Bill Gates Senior. 

> A partner brings something to the relationship that you lack; they inspire you to up your own game. Having someone taking the same risky step alongside you emboldens you to take the next one. 

> Our work styles, Paul and I learned were complementary. My approach was rapid-fire, in your face. I prided myself on my processing speed- that I could come up with the right answer, the best answer, on the spot. Impatient, real-time thinking. And I could work and work and work, for days on end, rarely stopping. Paul’s style was quieter, calmer. He had a lot going on in the inside. He mulled things over. He’d listen, process on his own. His intelligence was patient. He could wait for the right answer to arise. 

## Table etiquette  
> No eating in front of the television; don't put your elbows on the table; don’t bring ketchup bottle to the table. 

## Youth 
> It started with scotch. Really cheap scotch that Paul brought to the computer room. He got me drunk for the first time, so drunk I threw up and passed out that night in the Lakeside teacher’s lounge. That episode was followed days later by a demonstration of how to smoke a joint.

> I told Yale I wanted to get into government work, maybe law. I emphasized my experience in D.C and highlighted my love for the Boy Scouts and my pursuit of the dramatic arts. 
To Harvard, I expressed my interest in business or law. 

> Pinocchio’s, a pizza place in Harvard Square. If we were lucky, we’d arrive right when they were closing and get leftover pizzas on the cheap, the cheese already congealing. We’d push on until two or three, sometimes four in the morning, then grab a few hours’ sleep before rushing to class at eleven to hand in our answers. 

> Those first months of college, I was like a kid in a candy shop, dazzled by the seemingly limitless access to experts and intellectual stimulation. 

> A few weeks into the semester, I stopped going to class. I rationalized that since our whole grade was based on the final exam, all I had to do was learn everything by the end of the term. And since the organic chemistry lectures were videotaped and available in the science center, I could just watch those instead of watching the lectures live. Harvard had a wonderful thing called the reading period, which gave you nearly twenty days to study for final exams. I gambled that if I got my act together during reading period, I could study the book, watch the videos, and an ace crammer like me would do fine. If there was one thing I knew, it was how to turn on a maniacal focus and learn on my own.
