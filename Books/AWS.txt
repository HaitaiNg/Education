Uses buckets (unique name)
There are multiple storage classes:
Main difference is availability.

Relational DB 
RDBMS / ACID engine 
Uses the structured query language 
Uses a schema to define tables

Can store many different data types 
Generally accessed via RESTFUL HTTP 
No Schema required 
Every table must have a primary key 
Scales fast, & lighter in design
