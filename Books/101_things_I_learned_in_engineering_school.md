# Heat and Water Recycling

## Heat:
Heat is the movement of molecules within a material. The greater the rate of movement, the greater the heat.

## Water Recycling:

- **Black water:** Water that has come into contact with fecal matter. It is not suitable for reuse without extensive treatment.

- **Gray water:** Wastewater from bathing, cooking, washing, and mild cleansing that has not come into contact with fecal matter. It is not safe to drink but, with some treatment, is suitable for use in toilets and irrigation.

- **White water:** Potable (consumable) water from a natural source such as a spring, or water that has been treated to meet potable standards.

- **Rainwater:** Water collected from outdoor surfaces such as roofs. It may contain some contaminants from birds and chemicals but can generally be recycled for use in toilets, car washes, evaporative cooling systems, and plant irrigation.
