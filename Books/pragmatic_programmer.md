# Notes from: Pragmatic Programmer

## Key Principles

### Early Adopter
- Be a critical thinker, inquisitive, and realistic.
- Develop a broad skill set; become a jack of all trades.

### Maintain Quality
- **Do not leave broken windows** (bad designs, wrong decisions, poor code).
- Be a catalyst for change.

### Knowledge Portfolio
- Your knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets.
- Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio.
- Critically analyze what you read and hear.

## Programming as a Craft
- Programming is like painting:
  - Start with a blank canvas and basic raw materials.
  - Use a combination of science, art, and craft to build your system.
  - Sketch the overall shape, paint the environment, then fill in the details.

## Orthogonality
- Design systems that are:
  - **Easy to design, build, test, and extend.**
  - Independent and self-contained with a single well-defined purpose (cohesion).
- Examples:
  - Database code should be orthogonal to the user interface; changing one shouldn't impact the other.
- Orthogonality reduces interdependency among components and aligns with the **DRY principle**.

### Best Practices
- Organize teams around functionality, not job roles.
- Let teams organize internally, playing to individual strengths.

## Adaptive Code
- Code should:
  - "Rock on" when conditions are good.
  - "Roll with the punches" when requirements change.

## Estimation
- For accurate estimates, ask someone who has already completed a similar task.

## Debugging
- When debugging, interview the user who reported the bug to gather additional data.

## Metadata
- Metadata is data about data (e.g., data dictionary, data schema).
- A schema describes fields, storage lengths, and other attributes.
- Metadata guides application behavior and resource usage.

## Refactoring
- **Do not refactor and add functionality simultaneously.**
- Ensure strong test coverage before beginning refactoring.

## Understanding Requirements
- Requirements are often buried beneath layers of assumptions and politics.
- To understand user needs:
  - Immerse yourself in their environment (e.g., monitor help desk calls or work in the warehouse).
  - Building trust through active involvement enhances communication and improves system design.

## Communication
- Communicate clearly with others.
- Great teams have distinct personalities:
  - Meetings are well-prepared and engaging.
  - Documentation should be crisp, accurate, and consistent.
