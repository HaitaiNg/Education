> "You want to be extra rigorous about making the best possible thing you can. Find everything that's wrong with it and fix it. Seek negative feedback particularly from friends."  
> — *Elon Musk*

> "People are expected to do what it takes to get the job done, but they don’t have to go at it alone. Not getting the job done, though, is never an option."  
> — *Jamie Dimon*

> "We all have a short period of time on this earth. We probably only have the opportunity to do a few things really great and do them well. None of us has any idea how long we’re going to be here, nor do I, but my feeling is I’ve got to accomplish a lot of things while I’m young."  
> — *Steve Jobs*

In Order To Live A North Korean Girl's Journey To Freedom 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
> Once I was home, all I did was read. I inhaled books like other people 
breathe oxygen. I didn't just read for knowledge or pleasure; I read to live.
I had only $30 a month to spend, and after expenses, I would use everything 
I had left to buy books. Some were new; some came from a secondhand store. 
Even if I was hungry, books were more important than food. (229)

> I started with Korean translations of children's books, then moved on to 
picture books about the countries of the world. I bought books about 
Roman mythology and world history. I read biographies of Abraham Lincoln, 
Franklin Roosevelt, and Hilary Clinton. I was interested in America, 
and I particularly loved biographies because they were about people 
who had to overcome obstacles or prejudices to get ahead. They made me 
think I could make it when nobody else believed in me, when even 
I couldn't believe in myself. (229)

> I crammed twelve years of education into the next eighteen months of my life. (229)

> I was starting to realize that you can't really grow and learn unless you have 
a language to grow within. I could literally feel my brain coming to life, as if 
new pathways were firing up in places that been dark and barren. Reading was 
teaching me what it meant to be alive, to be human. (230)

The Mutt: How to Skateboard and Not Kill Yourself
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
> That’s what I’ve always loved — studying. Whether it’s skateboarding, the Bible, or math problems, I love focusing in until the rest of my world fades away.” (p. 121)

> I’m probably the only pro skater who studied the guidance systems of ballistic missiles and has a collection of Bible commentaries programmed into his palm pilot. I often listen to physics lectures while I drive and always have at least one book on quantum theory in my car in case I get stuck somewhere.

A Mathematician's Survival Guide: Graduate School and Early Career Development
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
> It would be easy to talk yourself into the pits if you sit around comparing yourself to others. 
Best is not to compare yourself to anyone at all. 
You were admitted by the faculty to the program you are now in, 
so you are definitely qualified. For this program, 
the powers that be have every expectation that you will succeed.

A Mathematician's Survival Guide: From Tenure to Emeritus
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
> It is really best if the five lecturers stick to a rigid syllabus and lesson plan, so that on any given day they are all teaching the same thing. That way if a student misses a class then he/she can go to a different lecture and not fall behind. Also the lecturers will all get to the same milestones at the same time so that they are all ready to give just the same midterm.

> Mathematics is also a critical part of modern technology. Most aspects of computer construction and design are mathematical. Ditto for the main ideas in cryptography, in medical imaging, and in many other hot fields. Calculus is a vital part of physics, economics, and population dynamics. Statistics is central to social science, engineering, and physics. Probability is the language of quantum mechanics, the social sciences, and finance. Discrete mathematics plays a vital role in information technology, biology, counting theory, and many other fields. Mathematicians make an essential contribution to the quality of life in this country. We are scholars of considerable gravitas.
So, yes, we are a service department. We give great service to the College, and to the University. But we are much more. We are at the forefront of modern scholarly thought. We are serious researchers engaged in important investigations. We have research grants, we receive invitations from all over the world, we are widely published, and we give considerable service to the mathematics and science professions. We are recognized academicians with worldwide reputations. We are an important part of the professoriate, ones who make notable contributions in many dimensions of the discipline.

> Tenure is the holy grail. Typically a career trajectory goes like this: Graduate school (4 to 7 years); Postdoctoral position (2 to 3 years); Assistant Professorship (4 to 6 years); Tenure decision; Associate Professorship (4 to 10 years); Promotion to full professor.

> Go some place where you absolutely, positively cannot be interrupted and sit in front of a tablet of paper and think hard and calculate. Try things. Scribble and conjecture and fiddle and tinker and make mistakes and try to learn from them. I’ve had great ideas while driving the car or taking a shower or lying on the lawn staring at the birds. But my most productive times have been times spent alone in front of the old tablet with a pen clutched in my fist, calculating away. If you can produce four productive hours like this five or six days per week, then you will be a very successful mathematician.

> Be of stout heart. Henrik Ibsen and Jane Austen and many another fine writer had his/her best work rejected. Some of my own finest and most influential papers were not only rejected at first, but were wholeheartedly insulted by the referees. And the editors were of no help either. In the intellectual world, tenacity and self-confidence are two of the most important attributes that you can have. Maintain your modesty and your dignity, but cultivate these two essential properties in yourself.

> If a paper is rejected, read the reports carefully and endeavor to learn from them. Find out how to make the paper better and do so. Show the paper to a senior mentor or even to a peer colleague. Do everything you can to capitalize on the situation and to learn something from it. Then re-submit and see whether you fare better. I have never had a paper that I could not get published. But I have stumbled, I have had papers rejected, I have needed to swallow my pride and work hard to shore up a paper before I could get it out the door. Sometimes I’ve had to publish in a journal that was a slice below my original sites. That is part of the publishing game; you will get used to it. And you will learn from it. In the end it is rewarding, and it will make you stronger.

> But there is another way to look at the matter. All the best mathematicians that I know are masters at snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. From a distance, it may look as though they bound from success to success, solving one big problem after another. This really is not true. Like most of us they end up sticking most of their work in the filing cabinet or the trash bin. But they have a specially developed skill for looking at a heap of calculations, and six months of trials and errors, and eliciting something of value from it. A weak or uncertain mind would just scoop up all the paper and dump it in the circular file. A more creative mind will think things over and say, “Well, I didn’t solve the big problem, but look at what I’ve learned. There are some new connections here, and that elucidates this other point.” And before you know it he/she has written a terrific paper.

> A good referee’s report should inform the editor (of the journal or publishing house) about the following aspects:
> - **Is this paper/book timely?**
> - **Is it interesting?**
> - **Is it correct?**
> - **Is it written in an attractive manner?**
> - **Are the references complete and accurate?**
> - **Are the graphics well-rendered?**
> - **Is the length suitable?**
> - **Is the result sufficiently important to be published?**  
  *(This query applies mainly to research papers, but the spirit of the question could apply to most any piece of writing.)*
> - **Is this author the right person to have written this piece?**


> The disadvantage is that you could easily become discouraged, demoralized, depressed. You could decide to give up, change careers, take a different job. These days almost everyone collaborates, and there is plenty of good reason to do so. Mathematics has become large and unwieldy. The problems are immense, and can be overwhelming. It is a great help to have a sounding board, a reality check, a verifier that only another person can be.

> I know mathematicians—good ones—who sit in their offices from 8:00am to 5:00pm each day, go home and have dinner with their families, and then go back to the office for a few (or sometimes several) more hours. I frankly don’t understand the point of this habit. There is no evidence that these people are any more productive than anyone else. And surely they have a workspace at the house. Why can’t they work at home, surrounded by their families, in the evenings? I would think it would put a strain on any relationship to have a partner who is married to his/her job to such a degree. And I repeat: where is the evidence that this leads to greater productivity?
You need to strike a balance between your professional life and your personal life.

> You owe something to your profession, but you also owe something to your spouse or partner. And of course to your children. I was talking to a mathematician a while ago about why he got divorced. His answer was, 'Early on in the marriage I told my wife my priorities: number one was mathematics; number two was my kids; and she came in number three. My wife accepted this, and we lived happily together for several years. But at some stage I took up running, and my wife could see that she was slipping into fourth place.” Well, this was an honest evaluation of his life, and it led to a predictable outcome. If you go back to the office each night after dinner then perhaps you are sending your spouse or partner a similar signal.
