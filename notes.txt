-node voltage analysis
-mesh current analysis
-Analog subsystems: modulators, oscillitators, RF amps, power supplies
-Digital subsystems: combinational logic, clocked digital abstraction, 
Embedded utilizes the analog and digital subsystems. 

A DC analysis will determine the voltage of every node in the circuit
at time t equals0 and the currents through the various components
Voltage values are often relative to a reference node called the "ground" node
When you change the location of the reference node. The total voltage across 
the circuit will be the same, however the relative values of the voltages
have now changed in respect to the intermediate node (current stays the same)

30V is considered dangerous voltage. 
electrically common points have zero voltage drop is a valuable
troubleshooting principle. If i measure the voltage between points
in a circuit that are supposed to be in common to each other. I should
read zero. If i read a vltage then they must not be connected
to each other 
Diode: a 1 way electric valve for electric current. Provides unimpeded
flow for current in 1 direction ( little or no resistence) but prevents
flow from the other direction (infinite resistence). Diode either
permits current or blocks current.
