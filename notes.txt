Embedded utilizes the analog and digital subsystems. 

A DC analysis will determine the voltage of every node in the circuit
at time t equals0 and the currents through the various components
Voltage values are often relative to a reference node called the "ground" node
When you change the location of the reference node. The total voltage across 
the circuit will be the same, however the relative values of the voltages
have now changed in respect to the intermediate node (current stays the same)

30V is considered dangerous voltage. 
electrically common points have zero voltage drop is a valuable
troubleshooting principle. If i measure the voltage between points
in a circuit that are supposed to be in common to each other. I should
read zero. If i read a vltage then they must not be connected
to each other 
Diode: a 1 way electric valve for electric current. Provides unimpeded
flow for current in 1 direction ( little or no resistence) but prevents
flow from the other direction (infinite resistence). Diode either
permits current or blocks current.

Analog signal is signal that is continously variable as opposed to 
having a limited number of steps along its range (digital). 
DC voltage can be used as an analog signal to relay information from one location to another 

Seebeck effect: production of small voltage across the length of a wire due to a difference in temperature along the wire. This effect is most easily observred and applied with a junction of two dissimilar metals in contact, each metal producing a different Seebeck voltage along its length, which translates to a voltage between the two (unjoined) wire ends. 

Seeback voltages are linear and quite small. When a pair of dissimilar metals are joined together for the purpose of measuring temperature, this is a thermocouple. 
Thermocouples made for instrumental use metals of high purity for an accurate temperature / voltage relationships.

ionic bonds are molecular unions formed when an electron deficient atom (positive ion) joins with an electron-excessive atom (negative ion).
