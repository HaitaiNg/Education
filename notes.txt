-node voltage analysis
-mesh current analysis
-Analog subsystems: modulators, oscillitators, RF amps, power supplies
-Digital subsystems: combinational logic, clocked digital abstraction, 
Embedded utilizes the analog and digital subsystems. 

A DC analysis will determine the voltage of every node in the circuit
at time t equals0 and the currents through the various components
Voltage values are often relative to a reference node called the "ground" node
When you change the location of the reference node. The total voltage across 
the circuit will be the same, however the relative values of the voltages
have now changed in respect to the intermediate node (current stays the same)

I just wanted to commit something lol
