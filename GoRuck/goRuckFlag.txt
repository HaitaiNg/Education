GoRuck Flag.

This American flag was designed and built by Haitai Ng for GoRuck Tough NYC 10/12/18. This flag
stands at 10ft x 3/4in, however the height can be re-adjusted to 5ft x 3/4in or extended to greater heights.
Constructed using EMT Steel conduit, this flag is strong yet very lightweight. EMT conduit
is one of the  lightest form of steel conduit and it is  a great conductor for electrical current so
you can use these poles for other projects.

Assembly 


Most flags have a hole located at the top left, and bottom left. The 
Stainless Steel Spring Lake will serve as the connection between the 
Zinc-Plated Steel eye bolts and the flag. 








Substitutions and Tips 
-The Stainless Steel Spring Lake can be replaced by any carabiner that can
fit thru the holes near the top left and bottom left of the flag.
-If you are unable to find a drill & drill bit to pierce the EMT conduit pipe,
you can try purchasing bungie cable and wrap the flag around the EMT
conduit pipe. When I originally built this I had less than 24 hours to find
a drill. This was my back up plan if I was unable to find a drill. 

*For those living in lower Manhattan, I visited and or contacted multiple
hardware, lumber, plumbing, and electricial stores in search of 
someone who would do a quick  drill job. You have two options: rent a drill from
Home Depot, or find a handyman that will do this service for a small service fee.
