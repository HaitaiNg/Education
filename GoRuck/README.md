#### Tools for Assembly: Drill; Measuring Tape; Phillips screwdriver 

#### Assembly
1. Drill four holes in one of the EMT conduit pipes (2 holes in the top, 2 holes below it). The holes at the top and bottom must directly  align with each 
other such that the steel eye bolts can pierce completely thru the EMT conduit 
and you can install the washer on the opposite end. There should be a 
34.8inch+ distance (max limit is 3ft (36inches)) between the top 2 holes and the bottom 2 holes.

2. Insert the steel eye bolts and washer. Attach the stainless steel spring lake to the top eye bolt and bottom eye bolt.

3. Attach the electric metallic set screw to the opposite side of the top. This will
serve as the connector to additional EMT conduit pipes.

#### Substitutions and Tips
- EMT conduit is one of the lightest forms of steel conduit. It is used to protect and route electrical wiring in houses and commercial buildings. You can substitute the EMT conduit with PVC or copper pipes.
- I designed this flag such that the length can be easily extended or reduced. To 
add length, attach EMT additional conduit pipes.
- I add an Electric Metallic set screw to the bottom of the EMT conduit pipe, and wrap it with 
medical tape, so I have a lower probability of scratching
or denting whatever hits this pole. 
- The Stainless Steel Spring Lake can be replaced by any standard carabiner that can
fit thru the holes of the flag. Most flags have the two holes on the left side of the flag,
thus making it easy to swap out flags if needed. 
- If you are unable to find a drill & drill bit to pierce the EMT conduit pipe,
you can try using bungie cable and wrap the flag around the EMT
conduit pipe. When I originally built this I had less than 36 hours to find
a drill. This was my back up plan if I was unable to find a drill and commit to my original design.
