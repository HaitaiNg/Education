Jamie Dion & Steve Jobs 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People are expected to do what it takes to get the job done, but they don’t have to go at it alone. Not getting the job done, though is never an option - Jamie Dimon 

“ We all have a short period of time on this earth. We probably only have the opportunity to do a few things really great and do them well. None of us has any idea how long we’re going to be here, nor do I, but my feeling is I’ve got to accomplish a lot of things while I’m young. “ — Steve Jobs
